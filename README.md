## Content

This year, the CDL Bootcamp training by D-Wave has five sections. Sections 1 and 3 use PowerPoint slides. The rest of the sections use the jupyter notebooks in this repository.

### Part 2: The summary of solvers
This section is a quick overview of a few solvers available in Ocean.

### Part 4: Tools for problem formulation
As you'll learn on the first day (QUBO module), you'll continue to practice problem formulation using Ocean tools.

### Part 5: DQM
The notebooks in this section take you through formulation with the DQM object.
